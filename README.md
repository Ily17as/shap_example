# SHAP Example: Explaining Predictions on the California Housing Dataset

This repository demonstrates the use of **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**, an advanced method for explainable AI based on game theory. SHAP helps explain the contribution of each feature to individual predictions, making machine learning models more interpretable.

## Overview

SHAP is a powerful tool for understanding machine learning models by breaking down predictions into contributions from individual features. This repository applies SHAP to the **California Housing Dataset**, a popular dataset for regression tasks.

### Key Features
- **SHAP**: Explains model predictions using Shapley values from cooperative game theory.
- **Model Interpretability**: Understand the contribution of each feature to the predictions.
- **California Housing Dataset**: Practical use case for showcasing SHAP's capabilities.
